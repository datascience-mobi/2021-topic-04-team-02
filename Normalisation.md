# What is data normalisation?
 
The process of efficiently _organising_ data:
1. eliminating duplicates
2. logically structuring "data dependencies"

In image analysis:
- standardisation aka mean = 0 and sd = 1
- stretching aka clipping intensities 
- scaling

Thoughts:
- any NA?
- Images the right way up?
- does removing duplicates interfere with the program?
